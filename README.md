SVD stands for Singular Value Decomposition, and it is a mathematical technique used in linear algebra.
Singular Value Decomposition breaks down a matrix into three other matrices, revealing the underlying structure and patterns within the original matrix.
It has applications in various fields, including signal processing, statistics, machine learning, and data analysis.

A=UΣV^T
where:
U is an orthogonal matrix containing the left singular vectors.
Σ is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values.
V^T is the transpose of an orthogonal matrix containing the right singular vectors.
